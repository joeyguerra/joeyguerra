            The Interplanetary File System (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System" title="What is IPFS?">IPFS</a>)
             is a software system that enables sharing files without having to upload them or host them on a centralized system. In more
             technical terms, IPFS is a decentralized, peer-to-peer distributed file system. I think it's super amazing, so I set out to
             use it for something simple like hosting my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            My website is just a bunch of files, HTML, CSS, javascript, and images; all in a folder called public. It's generated from 
             some templates. So I <a href="https://simpleaswater.com/installing-ipfs/" title="Install IPFS">installed IPFS</a> on my
             MacBook and opened up my website codebase with Visual Code. After generating the site, I added the public/ folder to the IPFS
             with <code>ipfs add -r public</code> and got this in the console.

        <p>
            I started the IPFS daemon with <code>ipfs daemon</code> and loaded up the site in my browser by constructing a URL
             with the CID (QmbjJSkDQWNTijRKJowT69pd4SAeZzUgFYN8Y5qYVRDXs8) for the public folder and voila, my site loads
             (http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmbjJSkDQWNTijRKJowT69pd4SAeZzUgFYN8Y5qYVRDXs8/).
        </p>

            I was excited until I clicked on the blog link and the page was broken. Images didn't load and it looked like the css
             wasn't applied. So I opened the web console and noticed a bunch of 404s. I looked at the URL bar and realized that all
             the paths for things like the CSS file were absolute, which resulted in an HTTP request for the CSS file that didn't
             include the CID. I also noticed after clicking on some of the links that they also resulted in 404s. Unfortunately,
             searches on the web didn't turn up any help, other than advice to make all links relative. And then I remembered
             something about HTML from the early days of the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's an HTML element called
             <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base" title="What is the base element?">&lt;base&gt;</a>
             which specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. So I just added a base element and iterated on
             different relative paths to find a pattern that worked consistently. As I worked through it, I realiazed how tedious it would
             be to do this for many pages so I found a pattern where all links can be relative while the base element href attribute
             would be the only piece that I have to set. For pages at the root level, I could add &lt;base href=&quot;./&quot;&gt; to the
             main layout HTML template. For the pages under the /blog/ path, I could add &lt;base href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;. And for the
             pages under the /blog/{year}/ path, &lt;base href=&quot;../../&quot;&gt; and this worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love the idea of the decentralized web. So I'm going to continue my exploration of the technologies that make it possible so
              stay tuned. I'll continue to post what I learn.
