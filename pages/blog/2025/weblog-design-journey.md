# Come Along My Weblog Design Journey

At my core, I want to do quality work. To me, __quality__ means "useful to someone".

I think [Clayton Chistensen's](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-essential-clayton-christensen-articles) ideas are currently one of the best frameworks to help guide designing useful things.

## Readers Hire Weblogs for Reasons

### Get Smart Quickly

> I hire a weblog to rapidly understand something without slogging through books or courses.

**Readers want:**

- Condensed mental models (for quick decision making)
- Clear explanations (for judging when a model applies)
- Opinionated takes (to challenge their own thinking)
- Practical insights (more judgement tools)
- A shortcut to someone else's hard-earned knowledge (avoid avoidable mistakes)

They want to reduce the time it takes to become competent.

### See How an Expert Thinks (Not Just What They Conclude)

> I hire a weblog to borrow someone else's reasoning process.

**Readers want:**

- A step-by-step reasoning flow (instructions)
- Decision criteria (what's important - and what's not)
- How trade-offs are handled (what's important - and what's not)
- How experts notice what others miss (don't want to be surprised with bad conequences)

People are not just hungry for answers - they're hungry for thinking patterns. They want to level up their sensemaking skills.

### Discoer New Ideas, Tools, and Strategies

> I hire a weblog to find new things I wouldn't have found on my own.

**Readers want:**

- Curated links (for more information - context, credibility)
- Novel concepts (be ahead of the curve)
- Emerging patterns (be ahead of the pack)
- Niche insights (don't be caught off-guard)
- "Edge of the internet" discoveries (FOMO)

They want to expand their sense of possibilities.

### Escape the Noise of Social Media

> I hire a weblog because I'm tire dof shallow takes and algorithmic junk.

**Readers want:**

- Depth (confident their mental model of the world is accurate)
- Focus (feeling productive)
- Slowness (not missing something)
- Signal over noise (actually making progress in their understanding of the world)

They want to replace dopamine-scrolling with meaningful learning.

### Build Trust in a Voice (Not a Brand or Algorithm)

> I hire a weblog to consistently hear from a person I **trust**.

**Readers want:**

- An unfiltered voice (something that sounds honest and not bullshit)
- No algorithmic manipulation (trustworthy)
- Predictable quality (don't want to be surprised in a negative way)
- A relationship with the author (connection to ideas that resonate, validation)

They want to reduce cognitive load by following a trusted mind.

### Find Someone Who Articulates What They're Already Feeling (this one is the most powerful job-to-be-done)

> I hire a weblog to put words to the vague intuitions I already have.

**Readers want:**

- Vocabulary for their experience (to be able to articulate the idea to someone else in an argument)
- Concepts that "finally explain it" (I want to be right)
- Validation that they're not alone (am I the crazy one?)
- A sense of intellectional companionship (a comfortable space to come back to when the world is insane)

Humans want to feel understood and gain language to express their own thinking.

### Join a Narrative or Journey (be part of a group for safety)

> I hire a weblog to follow someone who is going somewhere interesting.

**Readers want:**

- Behind-the-scenes progress (live thru vicariously - so they don't have to risk their current situation)
- Honest reflections (we're all alike right?)
- Experiments and failures (why do we all have to go thru the pain of failure? can't we learn from other's sacrifices?)
- Long-form arcs that unfold over months/years (consistency, comfort, a sense of comradery)

We want to participate in a story that inspires us.

### Make Better Decisions

> I hire a weblog to make more informed choices with less regret.

**Readers want:**

- Frameworks (easy to follow and replicate results)
- Heuristics (path of least resistance)
- Contrarian viewpoints (not a leming)
- Simplifications (easy - or at least the feeling of being easy)
- "Do this, not that" (help me avoid mistakes)

We want to increase decision quality without increasing effort.

## Emotional Jobs for Readers

- Identity
- Belonging
- Reassurance
- Inspiration

## What Readers Do When Weblogs Fail Them

- They turn to Twitter/X threads
- They hunt through Reddit
- They join Discord/Slack groups (and never really engage)
- They skim YouTube explainers
- They subscribe to newsletters instead (but do they really read them or just delete them when cleaning up their inbox?)
- They buy boooks they never finish
- They search StackOverflow endlessly

# Weblog Mission

> Become the trusted shortcut to understanding, clarity, and inspiration for ?????

**TODO: Figure out what I want to be a trusted source of knowledge and expertise for.**

# Core Jobs People Employ Weblogs To Do

- Make thinking visible for myself and others
    > I employ a weblog so I can externalize my ideas and see my thinking evolve over time (reflect on past opinions).
- Build compounding credibility
    > I employ a weblog so strangers can trust me without me having to pitch them.
- Create an always-on business development engine
    > I employ a weblog to attract customers while I'm busy doing the work.
- Teach at scale
    > I employ a weblog so I can teach once and reuse forever.
- Think in public to attract collaborators
    > I employ a weblog to signal the problems I'm interested in and attract the right people.

    > I employ a weblog to create a public lab notebook of what I'm building.
- Transform tacit knowledge into assets
    > I employ a weblog to convert my experiences into something that can be bookmarked, linked, or cited.
- Establish a home on the internet
    > I employ a weblog to own a place no algorithm can take away from me.

## Related Jobs

> Improve writing ability over time (writing is thinking), shape public perception of my career arc, pre-seed my audience for future products, test ideas before investing in them, serve as a sandbox for frameworks, create a body of work for future me, turn conversations into evergreen assets.

## Emoitional Jobs

# Iterate Over Every Job-to-be-done (Pick a job, execute a design iteration, pick the next job and repeat)

## Next: Translate Jobs into Job Requirements -> Design Criteria -> UI Patterns for the Weblog Design

### Get Smart Quickly

#### Requirements

- Reduce cognitive load
- make the core idea obvious within 5 - 15 seconds
- allow skim-first, read-depper-later
- visually summarize the post at the start
- avoid deep scroll walls

#### Design Criteria

**Cognitive Clarity**

- Every page must have a 5-15 second "graspable idea"
- Key takeaways must be summarized visually
- Navigation must show where you are and what else is adjacent

**Skimmability Without Shallowness**

- Content must be layered: overview -> details -> deep dive.
- Typography must support scanning: bold anchors, clear hiearchy.

**Structural Integrity**

- The mental model of the article must be visible.
- Readers must sense the shape of the argument.
- Articles must include structure markers (e.g., TL;DR, path diagram).

**Calm, Mission-Control Aesthetic**

- Spacious margins
- Monochrome + accent color
- Flight-manual typography
- Zero popups, autosresponders, or "growth hacks"
- A visual language of clarity (grids, lines, sharpness)

**Jobs-Based Navigation**

Not categories. Not tags.
Missions, jobs, and concepts.

Navigation must orient the reader by:

- Problem they're trying to solve
- Level of depth
- Domain (Systems, Leadership, Engineering, Integration)

**Trust-Forward Presentation**

- Author bio in sidebar
- "What I believe about X" pages
- "My current projects" status board
- Updates and logs (mission logs)

Turst is built through clarity, not persuasion.

**Narrative Continuity**

- Breadcrumbs for story arcs
- Season-based content groupings
- Mission log timeline
- Highlights for recurring themes

#### UI Patterns & Components

**Article Layout**

- Insight Header (5-second punchline)
    - Bold, distilled idea
    - Subtitle that frames context
- TL;DR Panel: Block at top containing:
    - The problem
    - The insight
    - The outcome
    - (Optional) Diagram miniature
- Reasoning Pathway: A vetical or horizontal diagram
    - How I got here
    - Key decisions
    - Alternatives rejected
    - What changed my mind
- Structured Sections: each with:
    - A bold insight header
    - 100-250 word explanation
    - Inline callouts ("Why this matters", "Trade-off", "Pattern")
- Concept Anchors: Glossary cards embedded inline
- Mission/Series Navigation
    - "Part of the X Mission" block
    - "Next->" and "Previous <-"
- Related Missions (Jobs-based)
    - Cards linking to content the reader might hire next.

**Reader Navigation Model**

Navigation is not chronological.
It's built around Jobs, Missions and Concepts.

*Jobs Navigation: Sections like:*

- Learn fast
- Fix Broken System
- Scale without the back office
- Build better integrations
- Think through complexitt

Each job acts as it's own "playlist".

*Missions (Narratives/Series): Examples:*

- Mission: Build the Hubot Data Plane
- Mission: Juphjacs Web Framework
- Mission: Scaling Field Ops SaaS
- Mission: Everday Systems Thinking
- Mission: Kaizen Ops Blueprint

These are story arcs.

*Concepts/Field Guides: These are recurring intellectural tools:*

- Leverage
- Feedback Loops
- Interfaces
- Idempotent flows
- State machines
- Coordination cost
- Observability
- Dynamic models

Each concept page is a mini playbook.

*Mission Dashboard (reader home page) - Think: NASA Mission Control meets a modern blog.*

- Start Here: A welcome explaining the blog's purpose and who it servers.
- Reader Jobs: Where do you want to go? Cards for each job.
- Big Ideas: My signature frameworks.
- Missions in Progress: Projects I'm actively writing about.
- Mission Log Timeline: A chronological view, but story-first.

*Concept Map Sidebar: Optional slide-out panel showing:*

- All major themes
- How they relate
- Expanded view of conceptual landscape
- Navigation through mental models

This helps readers "see the system" at a glance (re: seeing spaces)

*System architecture (reader mode) - High-level structure of the weblog system*

- Start Here (Priming layer)
    - Missions (Narrative layer)
        - Mission X
        - Mission Y
        - Mission Z
    - Jobs (Intent layer)
        - Get Smart Quickly
        - Escape the Noise
        - See How Experts Think
    - Concepts (Education layer)
        - Field Guides
        - Frameworks
        - Glossary
    - Articles (Content layer)
    - Mission Log (Chronology layer)

Multi-layer information architecture designed for progress, not posts.

*Design principles summary: The reader mode weblog UI must:*

- Make **thinking** visible
- Expose **reasoning**, not just results
- Enable **skim-first** reading
- Highlight **big ideas** visually
- Structure everything around **user progress**
- Create **calm amidst the noise**
- Turn the weblog into a **narrative system**, not a feed
- Show your personality and honesty
- Help readers **learn fast**
- Invite them into **missions**, not posts
