# What do you do when the business case isn’t there but you know intuitively that building software will improve the bottom line?

You start small and work outward from the middle. 

## Principles 

- **Don’t interrupt the flow of current business**. This doesn’t mean that if there’s a way to do something faster or better that we can’t consider it. It just means the default is don’t hurt the customers or our employees

- **Be transparent**. We need to be thinking out loud, saying what we intend to do in order to bring people along on the journey. The goal should be greater than 50% of the organization feels like they’re on the journey. 

- **Engage**. For those that are not working directly in the system, engage in discussions. Say what you know. Be curious and ask questions. Be on the journey.

## Architectural strategy

Identify data flows and processes and pick one to replace to start with. And then repeat.
