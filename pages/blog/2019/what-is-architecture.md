# What is Architecture

## Architecture Concerns

- Domain boundaries
- Component responsibilities (specific to owning, changing, reading data)
- Protocols, how systems communicate with each other
- High level physical view
- Clear network boundaries
- Scalability aspect
- Deployability aspects (characteristics and behaviours)
- Should allow CI/CD
- Where data resides, persists, GDPR and such

## Infrastructure Concerns
- Retries
- Data persistance
- Scaling functionality
- Concurrent access
