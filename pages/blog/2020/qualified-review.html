        <h3>
            Yeah Yeah, Let Us Get To It
        </h3>
        <p>
            TLDR; sure, just go ahead and try out <a href="https://www.qualified.io" title="Qualified">Qualified</a>.
            It's got an email like UI, lets you see a listing of candidates, assessments, send an invite to someone,
            track everyone's comments about a candidate, provides an IDE for the candidate to write and submit coding
            solutions, has a list of thoughtful coding problems for candidates to solve, provides a good UI to review
            the code and candidate. So yeah...that's pretty much it. I like that it does all those things, it feels
            feature complete to me. But there's another level to the problem and if you're interested in hearing what I
            think about that, read on. Otherwise, thanks for stopping by. Good luck.

        <h3>
            The Long(ish) Story
        </h3>
        <p>
            I started this post thinking I'd write a review about <a href="https://www.qualified.io"
                title="Qualified">Qualified</a>. I went back and forth with my opinion on it. As a matter of fact, we've
            spent about 2 weeks talking about <strong>skill assessment tools</strong> and <strong>interviewing
                people</strong> in general. Partly because we've been interviewing a lot, and partly because I feel like
            we're thoughtful people and want to <strong>genuinely identify and understand the problem</strong>.

                            I invited many of you to take <a href="https://www.qualified.io"
                                title="Qualified.io">Qualified.io</a> for a spin.

                        <p>
                            The idea is that we can use it in our hiring process to bring a bit more structure into the
                            mix.

                            I sent everyone the "basic pre-screen" questions.

                        <p>

            Trying to <strong>ascertain someone's skills is tough</strong> huh? I mean, even with a tool like <a
                href="https://www.qualified.io" title="Qualified">Qualified</a>, it's not really enough. You're still
            gonna have to <strong>spend time thinking about how the candidate solved the problems</strong>, what their
            code looked like, <strong>formatting</strong> and such; AND THEN, how all of those things <strong>map to
                skills</strong>. I mean, exactly <strong>what are the skills required to write quality
                software</strong>? How do you even <strong>define QUALITY</strong>? (if you're thinking it's bug count,
            this isn't the article for you; come back in 5 years when you're able to recognize the core problems)

                            First things first, what's the definition of quality software? Gotta have a clear answer for
                            that before anything else.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every time I think about what my answer to this question would be, I ask my self another
                            question, and that is, "from who's perspective?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It seems to me that quality means different things to different people. But if we hone in on
                            who the stake holders are in software, I'd say it's 2, well 3, but I think the business at
                            large is obviously a stake holder, but 2 are really important, the user and the developer (I
                            know, I'm biased, humor me).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having articulated that for myself, NOW I feel like I can come up with a really good
                            definition of quality. Here it is:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a user of the software, quality is the standard of page load, user error count, and
                            consistency as measured against the previous version's page load, user error count and
                            consistency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a developer of the software, quality is the standard of readability, discoverability and
                            leverage of existing code as measured against the previous version's readability,
                            discoverability and leverage of existing code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The key points being that it's a standard and measured relative to how it performed
                            previously.
                        </p>

            Luckily, I've spent some time thinking about this, so I feel like I can form some opinions. But not
            everybody has; frankly, <strong>there's skill involved in identifying someone's code that results from a
                particular skill</strong>. For instance, <strong>good formating</strong> is an indication that someone
            has the <strong>skill to write clean code</strong>. Hmm. I wonder how much code you'd have to read to be
            able to make that assessment reliably? I'm guessing more than just a few solutions to a generic Computer
            Science problem. Not that it's impossible, just that it's not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was what I was thinking about while using <a href="https://www.qualified.io"
                title="Qualified">Qualified's</a> code assessment UI. <strong>I was a little suprised that I could see a
                difference in skills when reviewing candidates (they were 2 other developers :) solutions to short
                problems</strong>. But I digress. I was thinking we have a bunch of developers, we can just create a
            code repo and define a problem ourselves for the candidate to solve; maybe we don't really need a tool to do
            that for us? I dunno yet. If you use <a href="https://www.qualified.io" title="Qualified">Qualified</a>, you
            wouldn't have to spend money solving that problem. Heh. That seems like a benefit.

            figuratively speaking of course.

                title="Austin Walters: Some super smart Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Data Science developer">Austin
                Walters</a>. Somehow you've reached out from the internet, forced Kenneth to read your article and post
            it on Slack; and making a point that really resonates with us too. People are complex, not only do we have
            many different skills, but we also have variations of them too, which makes us super interesting and also
            super hard to put in an Enterprise Job Description box. Crap. This is really hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            On one side of the spectrum, you have people who are looking for good talent...ah, the "it's so hard to find
            good talent" fallacy. Alas. Such a nuanced topic. What talent are you actually looking for? I think we can
            all agree, nobody's born with the skill for writing quality software. It's developed. So what does it take?
            If someone's really typing out lots of code per day, or quick to solve logic problems, does that mean they'd
            directly add value to the business? Or better yet, to the teams ability to deliver quality software? And
            there it is. There's the thing that's difficult to do. <strong>Identifying the skills required to CONTRIBUTE
                to our objectives</strong>, while at the same time, <strong>identifying the skills that would HINDER us
                from achieving our objectives</strong> (we don't want to hire those people, sorry, not sorry). <a
                href="https://www.qualified.io" title="Qualified">Qualified</a> isn't going to give you that. You have
            to figure that out on your own. And you're gonna have to figure it out regardless if you have a skill
            assessment tool. But I digress. There's the one side of the spectrum that's having a hard time finding good
            talent. And then there's the other side of the spectrum that isn't. What side are you on? Why do you think
            some people are having a hard time, while others aren't?
        </p>
        <p>
            I suspect it comes down to the individuals definition of talent and their understanding of the objectives;
            and whether or not they spend time to articulate the skills and talent they think will help them achieve
            those objectives. I personaly look for things like curiosity, grit, evidence of learning, before I think
            about whether they can solve a logic problem in code. But I think that's because I feel like I can teach
            someone to write quality software better than I can teach someone to be self motivated, respectful of
            others, or have a strong work ethic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phew. I hope this adds to your Machine Learning Data Model in your head with regards to whether or not to
