# Why People Hate Jira

When pressure is on - deadlines are real, stakes are high, and ambiguity is everywhere - teams don't want to manage tickets. 

> We want to think together.

Under real pressure, we need fast edits, prioritization without ceremony, partial thoughts that we can bookmark, rough language so we can move fast, and out-loud thinking.

Workflow tools are structured, typed, permissioned and schema-bound - constraints that create friction and resistance to fast, forward progress.

Thinking together is messy, nonlinear, and conversational - and that's exactly why it doesn't fit cleanly into tickets.

# Where Relying on Jira Fails

Jira and its ilk are fundamentally [state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).

State machines work best when the work is already understood - when the main question is "where is this?" not "what is this?"

When the pressure is high, people don't want to manage states:
- To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

... we want to **think together** - thinking vs tracking.

# The Tools Assume Clarity That Does Not Yet Exist

The problem isn't that Jira is bad, it's that it assumes clarity: a known goal, stable scope, and an agreed-upon path forward.

But that clarity often **emerges through conversation**, not before it.

The deeper issue is timing.

# Wrong Tool Because It's The Wrong Time

There are two different moments:
1. Figuring out the work - designing
2. Executing the work - executing

> Progress is experienced over time, not across columns.

# These Tools Drift

Another problem is that the tools drift from coordination to surveillance. Over time, these platforms often become:
- Reporting tools for managers
- Compliance systems
- Justification engines

Once a tool feels like oversight instead of support, we stop using it to think - and start using it to comply.

This is how drift shows up in practice.

I literally just created Jira tickets yesterday just to create a GitHub Pull Request to deploy a change to our stage environment.

What most teams are missing is a sense-making layer.

> A place where work becomes understood before it becomes tracked.
