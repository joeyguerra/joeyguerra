# SIGNAL Pre-Publish Checklist

(If it doesn’t clear every gate, do not ship.)

1. Core Claim Gate
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Can I state the core claim in one sentence?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it challenge a real assumption or decision?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Would I defend this claim in a room of operators?

Fail = Kill

2. 24-Hour Leverage Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> What decision changes because someone read this?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Could a reader act differently tomorrow?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Is the leverage explicit, not implied?

Fail = Archive

3. Model Shift Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does this replace a mental model (not add one)?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it make an old framing feel insufficient?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Would the reader see the system differently afterward?

Fail = Rewrite or Kill

4. Real System Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Is there a concrete system (people, workflow, physics)?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Are constraints and failure modes named?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Could this only be written by someone who’s been there?

Fail = Kill

5. Standalone Punch Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Can this be read cold with no backstory?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> No "Part 2," no dependencies, no setup doc?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it hit inside 60 seconds?

Fail = Rewrite

6. Novelty to Me Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Did I learn something writing this?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Did my thinking change mid-draft?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Is there at least one sentence I didn’t expect to write?

Fail = Kill

7. Edge & Friction Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does this create productive discomfort?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Is there a sharp line or unpopular truth?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it risk being misunderstood by skimmers?

Fail = Soften Later / Kill Now

8. Anxiety → Agency Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does this reduce confusion?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it give the reader a handle, rule, or test?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it leave them calmer or clearer?

Fail = Kill

9. Time Respect Gate

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Can this be consumed in 3–7 minutes?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Is every paragraph earning its keep?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Did I cut the part I’m emotionally attached to?

Fail = Cut More

10. Disqualification Scan (Final Sweep)

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Could this be a LinkedIn carousel?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it sound like thought leadership?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Does it optimize a broken system?
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Did I write it mainly to be seen?

Any Yes = Kill

FINAL DECISION

- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Clears all gates → SHIP
- <input type="checkbox" value="yes" /> Any gate failed → SILENCE IS BETTER

Publishing less is a feature.
