# Prompt
# I can't run the simulation directly, but I can help you modify the previous code to simulate a 72-hand shoe across 100 shoes. Below is the updated Python code that implements your prediction strategy and runs the desired simulation.

# Python Code for Simulation

# Here's a complete script that simulates 100 shoes with 72 hands each:

import random

# Function to determine the predicted first card based on the last two cards
def predict_card(last_two):
    card_values = {
        '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6,
        '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11,
        'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 1
    }
    last_card1, last_card2 = last_two

    # Calculate the intervals
    interval = abs(card_values[last_card1] - card_values[last_card2])

    # Check interval condition
    if interval > 4:
        return None  # Don't bet

    # Predict the next card (simplified logic for demonstration)
    if card_values[last_card1] < card_values[last_card2]:
        predicted_card = str((card_values[last_card2] + 1) % 13 + 1)  # Next card
    else:
        predicted_card = str((card_values[last_card1] + 1) % 13 + 1)  # Next card

    # Map 10, J, Q, K, A to their string representations
    for k, v in card_values.items():
        if v == int(predicted_card):
            return k

# Function to simulate the game
def simulate_baccarat(num_shoes, hands_per_shoe):
    outcomes = []
    last_two_cards = ['6', '4']  # Initial last two cards for prediction

    for shoe in range(num_shoes):
        for hand in range(hands_per_shoe):
            predicted_card = predict_card(last_two_cards)
            if predicted_card is None:
                continue  # Skip betting if the interval is greater than 4

            # Determine the bet based on prediction
            if predicted_card in ['7', '8', '9']:
                bet = 'B'  # Bet Banker
            else:
                bet = 'P'  # Bet Player

            # Simulate the outcome (random for demo purposes)
            actual_outcome = random.choices(['P', 'B', 'T'], [0.44, 0.46, 0.10])[0]
            outcomes.append((predicted_card, bet, actual_outcome))

            # Update last two cards (for this demo, randomize them)
            last_two_cards = random.choices(['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'], k=2)

    return outcomes

# Run the simulation
num_shoes = 100  # Number of shoes to simulate
hands_per_shoe = 72  # Number of hands per shoe
results = simulate_baccarat(num_shoes, hands_per_shoe)

# Analyze results
player_wins = sum(1 for _, bet, outcome in results if bet == 'P' and outcome == 'P')
banker_wins = sum(1 for _, bet, outcome in results if bet == 'B' and outcome == 'B')
ties = sum(1 for _, bet, outcome in results if outcome == 'T')

# Print results
print(f"Total Player Bets Won: {player_wins}")
print(f"Total Banker Bets Won: {banker_wins}")
print(f"Total Ties: {ties}")


### Explanation of the Code
# - **Predict Card Logic**: The function predicts the next card based on the last two cards played and avoids betting if the interval is greater than 4.
# - **Simulation**: The `simulate_baccarat` function runs through 100 shoes, with each shoe consisting of 72 hands. It places bets according to the prediction logic and tracks the outcomes.
# - **Outcome Analysis**: At the end of the simulation, the code counts how many times Player and Banker bets won, as well as the number of ties.

### Running the Code
# You can run this code in your Python environment as described previously. It will output the total wins for Player bets, Banker bets, and the number of ties after simulating 100 shoes with 72 hands each.
